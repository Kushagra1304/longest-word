Compounded Word Finder - C++ Program

Overview:

This C++ program is designed to find the longest and second-longest compounded words in a list of alphabetically sorted words read from an input file. A compounded word is a word that can be constructed by concatenating shorter words from the same list.

Design Decisions:

The program uses a recursive function to check whether a word is compounded by splitting it into prefixes and suffixes, and checking if both parts are present in the word list.
It utilizes an unordered_set for efficient lookup of words in the list and a cache (unordered_map) to store intermediate results to avoid redundant computations.
The program first reads the input file, sorts the word list by length in descending order, and then iterates through the sorted list to find compounded words.
Execution Steps:

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

Save the C++ code to a .cpp file, e.g., compounded_word_finder.cpp.

Create an input text file with alphabetically sorted words (e.g., Input_02.txt) in the same directory as the code.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Compile the program using the following command:

shell
Copy code
g++ -o compounded_word_finder compounded_word_finder.cpp
Execute the program with the following command, specifying the input file name as an argument:

shell
Copy code
./compounded_word_finder Input_02.txt
The program will process the input file, find the longest and second-longest compounded words, and display the results along with the time taken for processing.

Example Output:

Mathematica
Copy code
Longest Compound Word: ethylenediaminetetraacetates
Second Longest Compound Word: electroencephalographically
Time taken to process: 8000 milliseconds
Feel free to replace Input_02.txt with your own input file if needed.

This README provides a brief overview of the program, instructions on how to compile and execute it, and an example of the expected output. Adapt the README if you use the program with different input files or configurations.
